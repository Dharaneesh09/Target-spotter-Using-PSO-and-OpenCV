pipe_implementation.py - it is a basic program, which starts 2 processes and implements a pipe between them for Interprocess communication 

PSO example.py - Is basic Particle Swarm Optimisation implementation, on an array

PSO_tarInter.py - it's the main program, where PSO with multiprocessing and Inter Process Communication, is used to identify the target in the video footage and also an inerface is implemented
